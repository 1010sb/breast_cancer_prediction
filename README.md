# Breast Cancer Classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for breast cancer classification. The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset, which contains 569 instances and 30 features. The goal of the project is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the features provided in the dataset.

# Installation

## To run this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to view the code and results.

# Folder Structure

1. data/: contains the raw and processed data files
2. images/: contains all the images produced during the analysis, such as plots, diagrams, and screenshots of the web interface.
3. models/: contains the saved models generated by the scripts
4. notebooks/: contains the Jupyter notebook used for analysis
5. templates/: contains the index.html file for web interface.


Once you have installed the required libraries and opened the Jupyter notebook, simply run the cells in order to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the performance. 
The notebook is well-commented to guide you through each step of the process.

# Running the Flask Application on Local Server and Accessing the Web Interface
### Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run app.py to start the Flask application on your local server.
